# Setup

### Requirements

RESTHeart version required: 0.10.1 at least.

### Clone this project locally

    $ git clone git@github.com:SoftInstigate/restheart-blog-example.git

### Install Dependencies

    $ cd restheart-blog-example
    $ bower install

Donwload the latest [restheart binary distribution](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/releases/latest) archive, either the `tar.gz` or the `.zip` file.

Uncompress the downloaded archive, enter the folder and copy the `restheart.jar` binary file in the blog's main directory `restheart-blog-example` (this is to avoid editing the paths in the configuration file, since these must be relative to the restheart jar file)

### Run the Application

Start MongoDB and RESTHeart (refer to [RESTHEART documentation](http://restheart.org/docs/get-up-and-running.html) for more help)

    $ mongod --fork --syslog
    $ java -server -jar restheart.jar restheart.yml

The application is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog](http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog)

###Â Initialize the db

The very first time you'll be asked to initialize the database.
This is achieved executing the following `curl` commands from command line:

    $ curl -u admin:changeit -i -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8080/data/blog -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    $ curl -u admin:changeit -i -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8080/data/blog/posts -H "Content-Type: application/json"

## Run with docker

This is the simplest option. There's a docker-compose.yml which starts both RESTHeart and MongoDB as Docker containers.

   $ docker-compose up

The `docker` folder contains specific configurations for docker.

You still have to initialize the database. If docker run directly on Localhost (Linux box) then the above curl commands works, otherwise if you are running with docker-machine you'l probably have to change the IP to 192.168.99.100

    $ curl -u admin:changeit -i -X PUT http://192.168.99.100:8080/data/blog -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    $ curl -u admin:changeit -i -X PUT http://192.168.99.100:8080/data/blog/posts -H "Content-Type: application/json"
